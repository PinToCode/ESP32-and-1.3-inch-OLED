# ESP32 1.3 inch OLED Display Example

This is a simple Arduino sketch that demonstrates how to use a **1.3 inch SH1106 OLED display** with an **ESP32** board. The code displays static and dynamic text using the **Adafruit_SH110X** library.

## 🧰 Components Used

- ESP32 Development Board  
- 1.3 inch OLED Display (SH1106 controller, 128x64 resolution)  
- Jumper Wires

## 🔌 Wiring

| OLED Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|----------|-----------|
| VCC      | 3.3V      |
| GND      | GND       |
| SCL      | GPIO 22   |
| SDA      | GPIO 21   |

> 📌 Note: These are default I2C pins for most ESP32 boards. Adjust if needed.

## 📦 Library Dependencies

Install the following libraries via Arduino Library Manager:

- **Adafruit SH110X**
- **Adafruit GFX Library**
- **Wire.h** (included with Arduino IDE)

---

## 🧪 How It Works

- Initializes the SH1106 OLED display over I2C.
- Displays some static text on startup.
- In the loop, it refreshes every 2 seconds to show the elapsed time in seconds.
